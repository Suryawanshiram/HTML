                        The engine of the first version was a 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesel (1948 cc effective), equipped with indirect injection and KKK turbocharger with two valves per cylinder distribution capable of delivering 92 horsepower Euro 2. The engine is derived from the Peugeot XD88 unit built under license by Tata in India and used by Tata Telcoline and Sierra. With the Euro 3 standard power was reduced to 87 horsepower.
                        
                        A 2.1 litre 16V petrol engine was added in 2003. Is a straight-4 naturally aspirated developed by Tata Motors and AVL delivering 135 horsepower. In 2005, the 2.1 litre was discontinued.[8]
                        
                        The 3.0 Dicor engine (acronym for Direct injection common rail) is the first direct injection diesel engine fitted by the Indian company, a modern four-cylinder engine (derived from a Mercedes-Benz commercial unit), with common rail injection and sixteen valve distribution. It delivers maximum power of 116 hp (85 kW) and complies with Euro 3 regulations. Maximum torque is 300 N·m delivered between 1,600 and 2,000 rpm. The 3.0 Dicor diesel has been removed from the European price list in 2007 with the entry of the 2.2 Dicor engine but for the foreign markets the production of 3.0 has continued since it has found a robust and elastic engine despite the few horsepower in relation to the displacement.
